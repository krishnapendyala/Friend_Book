            <p align="justify">Existing social networking services recommend friends to users based on their social graphs, which may not be the most 
              appropriate to reflect a user’s preferences on friend selection in real life. In this paper, we present Friendbook, a novel semantic-based 
              friend recommendation system for social networks, which recommends friends to users based on their life styles instead of social 
              graphs. By taking advantage of sensor-rich smartphones, Friendbook discovers life styles of users from user-centric sensor data, 
              measures the similarity of life styles between users, and recommends friends to users if their life styles have high similarity. Inspired 
              by text mining, we model a user’s daily life as life documents, from which his/her life styles are extracted by using the Latent Dirichlet 
              Allocation algorithm. We further propose a similarity metric to measure the similarity of life styles between users, and calculate users’ 
              impact in terms of life styles with a friend-matching graph. Upon receiving a request, Friendbook returns a list of people with highest 
              recommendation scores to the query user. Finally, Friendbook integrates a feedback mechanism to further improve the recommendation 
              accuracy. We have implemented Friendbook on the Android-based smartphones, and evaluated its performance on both small-scale
              experiments and large-scale simulations. The results show that the recommendations accurately reflect the preferences of users in 
            choosing friends.</p>

            Recommendation System for Social Networks</h2>

            <p align="justify">One challenge with existing social networking services 
              is how to recommend a good friend to a user. Most 
              of them rely on pre-existing user relationships to pick 
              friend candidates. For example, Facebook relies on a 
              social link analysis among those who already share 
              common friends and recommends symmetrical users 
              as potential friends. Unfortunately, this approach may 
              not be the most appropriate based on recent sociology 
            findings [16], [27], [29], [30]. According to these studies, the rules to group people together include: 1) habits 
            or life style; 2) attitudes; 3) tastes; 4) moral standards; 
            5) economic level; and 6) people they already know. 
            Apparently, rule #3 and rule #6 are the mainstream 
            factors considered by existing recommendation systems.</p>
